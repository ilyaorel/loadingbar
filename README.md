LOADING BAR
============
*by Ilya Orel*

This is one of my first projects integrating JS, HTML and CSS on my own.

#Funtionality

- There is a loading bar type and two action buttons
- Every time you hit the 'Go!' button the bar fills 1%
- Every time you git the '+5' is clicked the bar fills 5%
- There is a cheer up message appearing at some levels to encourage clicking activity.
